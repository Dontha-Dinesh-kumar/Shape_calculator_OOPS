# Shape Area Calculator

This mini project demonstrates the use of Python's `abc` module with abstract base classes to calculate the area of geometric shapes like squares and rectangles.

## Features
- Uses abstraction with `abc.ABC`
- Rectangle and Square classes implement the `area()` method
- Encapsulation used for square side

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
